# iPerf3 Python Wrapper

The original iperf3-python wrapper at https://iperf3-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ had some missing features.
I modified the wrapper to add DSCP / TOS options. The Client/Server python scripts is an example of using multiprocessing for multiple stream testing. There was an issue with iPerf and multithreading.
